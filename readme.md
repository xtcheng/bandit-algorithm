## Algorithm
* The Epsilon-Greedy algorithm balances exploration and exploitation. With probability epsilon, the algorithm chooses a random arm (exploration), and with probability 1-epsilon, it chooses the arm with the highest expected reward (exploitation).

* The UCB algorithm  

## Usage
To run the code, simply run `main.py`. You can modify the parameters such as the number of arms, the number of trials, and the epsilon value to experiment with different scenarios.
